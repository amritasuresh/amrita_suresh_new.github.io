## Currently

I'm a second year PhD student at the LSV, ENS Paris Saclay. I am working on analysing underapproximations for the verification of distributed systems which communicate asynchronously via buffers of unbounded size. 

## Education

`2017-19`
__Ecole Normale Superieure Paris Saclay__ MPRI (Master Parisien de Recherche en Informatique)  (_magna cum laude_)

`2012-16`
__Birla Institute of Technology and Science__ B.E (Hons.) Computer Science (undergraduate thesis advisor: Nutan Limaye, IIT Bombay). My undergraduate thesis was titled _Circuit Complexity and Parallel Algorithms_ and is available on [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gygo399vhu8agtm/Amrita_Bachelor_report.pdf?dl=0).

### Talks

`2020`
Bounded Reachability is Decidable in FIFO Machines (_MOVEP 2020, CONCUR 2020_)


`2018`

## Internships

`2018`
__Technical University of Munich__ (_Munich, Germany_)
Worked in the group of Prof. Javier Esparza. Addressed the problem of automatic verification of population protocols, and extended the subclass of population protocols which can be automatically verified, using ideas from Petri Nets and infinite state systems. Worked on enhancing the performance of the tool PEREGRINE.

`2015`
__Intuit India Development Centre (Small Business Group)__ (_Bangalore, India_)
Helped the migration of QuickBooks accounts to Amazon Web Services, and the integration of SalesForce DotCom. 

`2014`
__Indian Space Research Organization (Satellite Centre)__ (_Bangalore, India_)
Worked for the summer on the estimation of the parameters of solar cells from current-voltage characteristics using genetic algorithm. Also set up an online tool for the analysis of solar cell performance for the Power Systems Group.
