## Internships

`2018`
__Technical University of Munich__ (_Munich, Germany_)
Worked in the group of Prof. Javier Esparza. Addressed the problem of automatic verification of population protocols, and extended the subclass of population protocols which can be automatically verified, using ideas from Petri Nets and infinite state systems. Worked on enhancing the performance of the tool PEREGRINE.

`2015`
__Intuit India Development Centre (Small Business Group)__ (_Bangalore, India_)
Helped the migration of QuickBooks accounts to Amazon Web Services, and the integration of SalesForce DotCom. 

`2014`
__Indian Space Research Organization (Satellite Centre)__ (_Bangalore, India_)
Worked for the summer on the estimation of the parameters of solar cells from current-voltage characteristics using genetic algorithm. Also set up an online tool for the analysis of solar cell performance for the Power Systems Group.
