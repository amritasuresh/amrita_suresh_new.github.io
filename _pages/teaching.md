Over the duration of my PhD, I have taught courses in __Systems and Architecture__ and __Programming I__ (for undergraduate students (L3)), and also the advanced master's level course of __Tree Automata and Their Applications__ at the ENS Paris Saclay.

I have dedicated pages to these courses. If you want to have a look at the archives, shoot me an email and I can redirect you.
