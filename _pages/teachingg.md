# Programmation 1, L3, ENS-Paris-Saclay (2020-2021)

## Exercise sessions

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

1. [TD1](TD1/TD1.pdf)
This TD covers the basics of different programming paradigms, some introduction to common character encodings, and some information on representation of numbers in the system.

2. [TD2](TD2/TD2.pdf)
This TD focuses primarily on assembler code (x86) and understanding the conversion between C and assembly languages.

3. [TD3](TD3/TD3.pdf)
This TD focuses on MIPS assembly language, some compiler optimizations, and we also begin the study of pointers.

4. [TD4](TD4/TD4.pdf) 
This TD starts with understanding how pointers behave in different languages, then we look at structures and how they are stored in the memory, and finally, we look at string manipulation in C.

5. [TD5](TD5/TD5.pdf) 
This TD deals with static and dynamic binding, along with some examples on call by value, reference, name and need.

SEMANTICS

1. [TD6](TD6/TD6.pdf)
This TD deals with an Introduction to Operational Semantics.

2. [TD7](TD7/TD7.pdf)
This TD deals with Lattices, Knaster-Tarski, and DCPOs. Solutions available here: [All solutions](TD7/TD7-solutions.pdf) [Exercise 1.2](TD7/TD7_ex1_solution.pdf) 

3. [TD8](TD8/TD8.pdf)
This TD deals with semantics for graphs, DCPOs and some topology. [Solution key](TD8/TD8-solutions.pdf)

4. [TD9](TD9/TD9.pdf)
This TD explores further on the topics of Scott-topology, separation and semantics. [Solution key](TD9/TD9-key.pdf)

5. [TD10](TD10/TD10-questions.pdf)
This TD deals with axiomatic semantics, Hoare logic and notions of Weakest liberal preconditions. [Solution](TD10/TD10-solution.pdf)

6. [TD11](TD11/TD11-questions.pdf)
This TD deals with notions of PCF, type systems, etc. [Solution](TD11/TD11.pdf)

7. [TD12](TD12/TD12-questions.pdf)
This TD looks at a variant of PCF with reals. [Solution](TD12/TD12.pdf) ([Short note](TD12/PCF_v.pdf) on PCF call-by-need vs call-by-value (response to question)). 

8. [TD13](TD13/TD13-questions.pdf)
This last TD on semantics looks at typing. [Solution key](TD13/TD13.pdf)

ABSTRACT INTERPRETATION

1. [TD14](TD14/TD14-question.pdf)
Introduction to abstract interpretation. [Solution](TD14/TD14.pdf)
