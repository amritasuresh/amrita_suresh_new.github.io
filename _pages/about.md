Hello! I am Amrita, a third year doctoral student at the [LMF](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/), [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en). My advisors are [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel/) and [Benedikt Bollig](https://www.benedikt-bollig.org/). I am broadly working in the field of verification of distributed systems - more specifically on analysing asynchronous systems with unbounded buffers. 

Some of the topics I have worked on in the past have been input-bounded FIFO systems, the notions of synchronizability (using a Message Sequence Chart approach), and more recently, reversal boundedness and extensions of Well Structured Transition Systems. But apart from this, my interests lie with anything to do with verifying infinite state systems, and their characterization using logics and automata.

My office is at **2S63**. You can contact me at (+33) 01 81 87 54 66 or via [email](mailto:asuresh@lsv.fr).
