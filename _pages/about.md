Hello! I am Amrita, a second year doctoral student at the [LMF](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/), [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en). My advisors are [Alain Finkel](http://www.lsv.fr/~finkel/) and [Benedikt Bollig](https://www.benedikt-bollig.org/). I am broadly working in the field of verification of infinite state systems - more specifically on reachability analysis for underapproximations of asynchronous distributed systems with unbounded buffers. Reach out to know more!
